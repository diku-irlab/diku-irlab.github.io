Retrieval.\nUnsupervised Neural Generative Semantic Hashing Fast similarity search is a key component in large-scale information retrieval, where semantic hashing has become a popular strategy for representing documents as binary hash codes. Recent advances in this area have been obtained through neural network based models: generative models trained by learning to reconstruct the original documents. We present a novel unsupervised generative semantic hashing approach, \\textit{Ranking based Semantic Hashing} (RBSH) that consists of both a variational and a ranking based component. Similarly to variational autoencoders, the variational component is trained to reconstruct the original document conditioned on its generated hash code, and as in prior work, it only considers documents individually. The ranking component solves this limitation by incorporating inter-document similarity into the hash code generation, modelling document ranking through a hinge loss. To circumvent the need for labelled data to compute the hinge loss, we use a weak labeller and thus keep the approach fully unsupervised.\nExtensive experimental evaluation on four publicly available datasets against traditional baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods for semantic hashing shows that RBSH significantly outperforms all other methods across all evaluated hash code lengths. In fact, RBSH hash codes are able to perform similarly to state-of-the-art hash codes while using 2-4x fewer bits.\nContextually Propagated Term Weights for Document Representation Word embeddings predict a word from its neighbours by learning small, dense embedding vectors. In practice, this prediction corresponds to a semantic score given to the predicted word (or term weight). We present a novel model that, given a target word, redistributes part of that word\u0026rsquo;s weight (that has been computed with word embeddings) across words occurring in similar contexts as the target word. Thus, our model aims to simulate how semantic meaning is shared by words occurring in similar contexts, which is incorporated into bag-of-words document representations. Experimental evaluation in an unsupervised setting against 8 state of the art baselines shows that our model yields the best micro and macro F1 scores across datasets of increasing difficulty.\n","date":1556748000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556748000,"objectID":"ab9314c730f7578f74ae61ff8c427d23","permalink":"/post/sigir2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-02T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/sigir2019/","section":"post","summary":"The IR lab got two papers accepted at the 42nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval.\nUnsupervised Neural Generative Semantic Hashing Fast similarity search is a key component in large-scale information retrieval, where semantic hashing has become a popular strategy for representing documents as binary hash codes.

Most prior research on (i) uses hand-crafted features to select check-worthy sentences, and does not explicitly account for the recent finding that the top weighted terms in both check-worthy and non-check-worthy sentences are actually overlapping [15]. Motivated by this, we present a neural check-worthiness sentence ranking model that represents each word in a sentence by both its embedding (aiming to capture its semantics) and its syntactic dependencies (aiming to capture its role in modifying the semantics of other terms in the sentence). Our model is an end-to-end trainable neural network for checkworthiness ranking, which is trained on large amounts of unlabelled data through weak supervision. Thorough experimental evaluation against state of the art baselines, with and without weak supervision, shows our model to be superior at all times (+13% in MAP and +28% at various Precision cut-offs from the best baseline with statistical significance). Empirical analysis of the use of weak supervision, word embedding pretraining on domain-specific data, and the use of syntactic dependencies of our model reveals that check-worthy sentences contain notably more identical syntactic dependencies than non-check-worthy sentences\nContextual Compositionality Detection with External Knowledge Basesand Word Embeddings When the meaning of a phrase cannot be inferred from the individual meanings of its words (e.g., hot dog), that phrase is said to be non-compositional. Automatic compositionality detection in multiword phrases is critical in any application of semantic processing, such as search engines [9]; failing to detect non-compositional phrases can hurt system effectiveness notably. Existing research treats phrases as either compositional or non-compositional in a deterministic manner. In this paper, we operationalize the viewpoint that compositionality is contextual rather than deterministic, i.e., that whether a phrase is compositional or non-compositional depends on its context. For example, the phrase “green card” is compositional when referring to a green colored card, whereas it is non-compositional when meaning permanent residence authorization. We address the challenge of detecting this type of contextual compositionality as follows: given a multi-word phrase, we enrich the word embedding representing its semantics with evidence about its global context (terms it often collocates with) as well as its local context (narratives where that phrase is used, which we call usage scenarios). We further extend this representation with information extracted from external knowledge bases. The resulting representation incorporates both localized context and more general usage of the phrase and allows to detect its compositionality in a non-deterministic and contextual way. Empirical evaluation of our model on a dataset of phrase compositionality1 , manually collected by crowdsourcing contextual compositionality assessments, shows that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines notably on detecting phrase compositionality.\n","date":1556748000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556748000,"objectID":"0e2abab6deffda722e22988da67b0358","permalink":"/post/www2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-02T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/www2019/","section":"post","summary":"The IR lab got papers accepted at two different WWW workshops: International Workshop on Misinformation, Computational Fact-Checking and Credible Web and International Workshop of Deep Learning for Graphs and Structured Data Embedding\nNeural Check-Worthiness Ranking with Weak Supervision: Finding Sentences for Fact-Checking  Automatic fact-checking systems detect misinformation, such as fake news, by (i) selecting check-worthy sentences for fact-checking, (ii) gathering related information to the sentences, and (iii) inferring the factuality of the sentences.","tags":null,"title":"Two papers accepted at WWW workshops","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Researchers from the IR lab competed in the Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge at WSDM Cup.

Understanding the influence of media coverage upon vaccination activity is valuable when designing outreach campaigns to increase vaccination uptake. Objective: To study the relationship between media coverage and vaccination activity of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in Denmark. Methods: We retrieved data on media coverage (1622 articles), vaccination activity (2 million individual registrations), and incidence of measles for the period 1997-2014. All 1622 news media articles were annotated as being provaccination, antivaccination, or neutral. Seasonal and serial dependencies were removed from the data, after which cross-correlations were analyzed to determine the relationship between the different signals. Results: Most (65%) of the anti-vaccination media coverage was observed in the period 1997-2004, immediately before and following the 1998 publication of the falsely claimed link between autism and the MMR vaccine. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the first MMR vaccine (targeting children aged 15 months) and provaccination media coverage (r=.49, P=.004) in the period 1998-2004. In this period the first MMR vaccine and neutral media coverage also correlated (r=.45, P=.003). However, looking at the whole period, 1997-2014, we found no significant correlations between vaccination activity and media coverage. Conclusions: Following the falsely claimed link between autism and the MMR vaccine, provaccination and neutral media coverage correlated with vaccination activity. This correlation was only observed during a period of controversy which indicates that the population is more susceptible to media influence when presented with diverging opinions. Additionally, our findings suggest that the influence of media is stronger on parents when they are deciding on the first vaccine of their children, than on the subsequent vaccine because correlations were only found for the first MMR vaccine.

Each ESR will be aware that the current state of the art of IAR is not sufficient to address the challenges of a dynamic, adaptive and context-aware user-machine interaction and to make a major breakthrough in the overall effectiveness of retrieval systems, and that a genuine theoretical breakthrough is on the contrary necessary. We believe that this breakthrough can be provided by quantum theory which can integrate abstract vector spaces, probability spaces and logic in a single theoretical framework which extend and generalize the classical vector, probability and logic spaces utilised in IAR. QUARTZ will consist of training activities and ESR research projects which investigate theoretical issues and evaluate methods and prototypes for adaptive IAR systems managing large data collections and meeting the end user\u0026rsquo;s information needs in a dynamic context.\nFunded by: Horizon 2020 (MSCA-ITN-ETN) Period: 2017 - 2020\n","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"dcbc44c159d1c8d6bead6667f059ba5d","permalink":"/project/quantum/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/quantum/","section":"project","summary":"We aim to establish an European Training Network (ETN) on QUantum information Access and Retrieval Theory (QUARTZ).
